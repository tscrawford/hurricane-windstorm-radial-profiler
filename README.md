Parametric modeling framework for predicting the decay of tropical cyclone winds

Winds distribution speeds are a critical ingredient for most cyclone catastrophe 
modeling.  Hurricane winds damage civil structures, drive storm surges, and can produce
torrential rainfalls that often produce inland flooding. In order to produce realistic 
potential damage assessments, a realistic hurricane wind profile can be a cheap computational 
estimate for risk assessment.

This model produces a spatial representation of cyclone wind speeds by sweeping out a hurricane 
wind decay model from Willoughby et. al (2006).
